# Air Traffic Control

An air traffic control program that originated "backwards" from a
pong game.

I found a JS tutorial that implemented the game pong. I knew I had
some Java graphics routines from univ courses and decided to "port"
the game to Java, but quickly switched to writing a collision
detection program. Once done with that, I wanted to add a way of
controlling the "balls" in the program. Unfamiliar with Java IPC, I
started writing a C program. Ran into some blocking issues and
simplified the model to a single dimension (point on a line).

At the time of repo initialization, what was required to make the
program "interesting" again was bringing back 2D and adding back
graphics routines (had some Xlib routines up my sleeve).

Under heavy construction and restructuring.

Removed files with early attempts at this project.

Added some collision detection functions, to be integrated at a later
time.

Will work on this little project when I have time.

Basic functionality for changing the direction of an airplane has been
